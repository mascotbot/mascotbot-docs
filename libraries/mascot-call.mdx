MascotCall encapsulates the core call-handling logic. It is designed to work in tandem with [MascotClient](react-sdk) and the underlying voice client from the Pipecat platform. For a general integration of the Mascotbot React SDK, see the [Mascotbot React SDK Documentation](react-sdk).

---

## Overview

The `MascotCall` component enables you to provide real-time call interaction features in your application. It offers you:

- A call “start” mechanism that connects to the backend via an API endpoint.
- A control interface exposing start/end call and toggle audio (mute/unmute) buttons.
- Integrated TTS support—for example, using the ElevenLabs engine.
- Full integration with a Rive animation for your mascot via the `MascotRive` component.

Internally, `MascotCall` uses the Pipecat voice client alongside media handling and state management hooks from `@mascotbot-sdk/react`.

---

## Installation

First, ensure you have installed the Mascotbot React SDK along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install ./mascotbot-sdk-react-0.1.0.tgz
```

For full installation and setup details, please see the [Mascotbot React SDK Docs](react-sdk).

---

## Usage

`MascotCall` works as a child of the `MascotClient` component and must be wrapped in a valid client context. The typical integration flow is as follows:

1. **Load Your Mascot Animation:**  
   Create and load your Rive instance using the `useRive` hook (from `@rive-app/react-canvas`).

2. **Wrap with MascotClient:**  
   Pass your Rive instance and any custom state-machine input names (e.g. `"thumbs_up"`) to `MascotClient`.

3. **Integrate MascotCall:**  
   Within the `MascotClient`, add the `MascotCall` component. Provide your API endpoint and TTS configuration (if needed) as props. Use the render prop function to access call controls and state.

---

## Props

The `MascotCall` component accepts the following props:

- **apiUrl (string, required):**  
  The URL of your backend API endpoint that handles call signaling.

- **tts (object, optional):**  
  Configures Text-To-Speech (TTS) with the following properties:
  - `engine` (string): The TTS engine (e.g. `"elevenlabs"`, `"cartesia"`, or `"kokoro"`).
  - `voice` (string): The identifier for the selected voice.

- **onStateChange (function, optional):**  
  Callback that is invoked on transport state changes (e.g. `"disconnected"`, `"connecting"`, `"ready"`).

- **children (function or React node, required):**  
  A render prop that provides the control props:
  - `startProps`: Props to trigger a start call action.
  - `endProps`: Props to trigger the call-end action.
  - `muteProps`: Props to toggle mute/unmute.
  - `state`: The current transport state.
  - `muted`: Boolean indicating if the mic is muted.

---

## TTS Configuration

Within the `tts` prop you can define the TTS engine and voice settings. For example:

```jsx
tts={{
  engine: "elevenlabs",
  voice: "your-voice-id"
}}
```

You can adjust these settings based on your subscription and the supported providers on your backend.

## Code Example

Below is a complete integration example for `MascotCall`. This example shows how to set up your Rive instance, wrap your app with `MascotClient`, and integrate the `MascotCall` component with a custom UI using its render prop.

```jsx
import { MascotCall, MascotClient, MascotRive } from "@mascotbot-sdk/react";
import { Alignment, Fit, Layout, useRive } from "@rive-app/react-canvas";

// Replace with your API endpoint.
const MASCOT_CALL_API_URL = "your-endpoint-domain";

export default function Call() {
  const rive = useRive(
    {
      src: "your_rive_file_url",
      artboard: "YourArtboard",
      animations: "YourAnimation",
      stateMachines: "YourStateMachine",
      autoplay: true,
      layout: new Layout({
        fit: Fit.FitHeight,
        alignment: Alignment.Center,
      }),
    },
    {
      shouldResizeCanvasToContainer: true,
    }
  );

  return (
    <MascotClient rive={rive} inputs={["thumbs_up"]}>
      <div style={{ position: "relative", height: "100%" }}>
        <MascotCall
          apiUrl={MASCOT_CALL_API_URL}
          tts={{ engine: "elevenlabs", voice: "your-voice-id" }}
          onStateChange={(state) => console.log("Call state:", state)}
          debug
        >
          {(provided) => (
            <>
              <MascotRive
                onClick={({ inputs }) => {
                  inputs?.thumbs_up && inputs.thumbs_up.fire();
                }}
              />

              <div
                style={{
                  position: "absolute",
                  bottom: 0,
                  insetInline: 0,
                  paddingBottom: 16,
                  zIndex: 50,
                }}
              >
                <div
                  style={{
                    display: "flex",
                    flexDirection: "column",
                    rowGap: 6,
                    width: "max-content",
                    marginInline: "auto",
                  }}
                >
                  {provided.state === "disconnected" ? (
                    <button {...provided.startProps}>Start</button>
                  ) : provided.state === "ready" ? (
                    <button
                      {...provided.endProps}
                      style={{ backgroundColor: "red", color: "white", borderColor: "red" }}
                    >
                      End
                    </button>
                  ) : (
                    <button
                      style={{ opacity: 0.5, pointerEvents: "none" }}
                    >
                      Connecting…
                    </button>
                  )}
                  <button {...provided.muteProps}>
                    {provided.muted ? "Unmute" : "Mute"}
                  </button>
                </div>
              </div>
            </>
          )}
        </MascotCall>

        <div
          style={{
            position: "absolute",
            bottom: 0,
            insetInline: 0,
            height: 150,
            background:
              "linear-gradient(to top, rgb(255, 255, 255) 15%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0))",
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </MascotClient>
  );
}
```
