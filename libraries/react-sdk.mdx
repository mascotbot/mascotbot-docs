## Introduction

The MascotBOT SDK provides a set of tools and components to integrate interactive mascots into your React applications. This documentation will guide you through the installation process and explain the main mechanisms and hooks available in the SDK.

## Installation

To install the MascotBOT SDK, you need to add the package to your project. You can do this using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install ./mascotbot-sdk-react-0.1.0.tgz
```

```bash yarn
yarn add ./mascotbot-sdk-react-0.1.0.tgz
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add ./mascotbot-sdk-react-0.1.0.tgz
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>You'll get the latest version of our SDK with integration examples once you subscribe to one of our plans</Note>

Ensure that you have the required peer dependencies installed:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install react react-dom
npm install @rive-app/canvas @rive-app/react-canvas
```

```bash yarn
yarn add react react-dom
yarn add @rive-app/canvas @rive-app/react-canvas
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add react react-dom
pnpm add @rive-app/canvas @rive-app/react-canvas
```

</CodeGroup>

## Setup

### 1. Import and Wrap with `MascotProvider`

To use the SDK, wrap your application with the `MascotProvider` component.

```jsx
import { MascotProvider } from "@mascotbot-sdk/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <MascotProvider>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </MascotProvider>
  );
}
```

### 2. Create a Rive Instance

Use the `useRive` hook to create a Rive instance. This instance will manage the animations and state machines for your mascot.

```jsx
import { useRive } from "@rive-app/react-canvas";

const rive = useRive({
  src: "your_rive_file_url",
  artboard: "YourArtboard",
  animations: "YourAnimation",
  stateMachines: "YourStateMachine",
  autoplay: true,
});
```

### 3. Use `MascotClient`

The `MascotClient` component connects your Rive instance with the MascotBOT SDK.

```jsx
import { MascotClient } from "@mascotbot-sdk/react";

<MascotClient rive={rive}>
  <YourMascotComponent />
</MascotClient>
```

## Hooks

### `useMascot`

The `useMascot` hook provides access to the Rive instance and Rive component.

```jsx
import { useMascot } from "@mascotbot-sdk/react";

const { rive, RiveComponent } = useMascot();
```

### `useMascotPlayback`

The `useMascotPlayback` hook allows you to control the playback of animations and manage visemes.

```jsx
import { useMascotPlayback } from "@mascotbot-sdk/react";

const playback = useMascotPlayback();
playback.play();
playback.pause();
```

## Handling Visemes and Audio Playback

To create a synchronized animation and audio experience, you can use the `playback.add` method to add visemes. This can be done in various ways, such as fetching from a server, generating in real-time, or any other method suitable for your application.

### Adding Visemes

Visemes are visual representations of phonemes. You can add them to the playback to synchronize with the audio.

```jsx
const visemes = /* Obtain visemes from your source */;
playback.add(visemes);
```

### Adding Audio

For speech playback, you need to provide an audio source. This can be done by setting the audio source dynamically.

```jsx
const audioElement = /* Reference to your audio element */;
audioElement.src = "your_audio_source";
audioElement.play();
```

## Conclusion

The MascotBOT SDK offers a flexible and powerful way to integrate mascots into your React applications. By following the setup instructions and utilizing the provided hooks, you can create engaging and interactive experiences for your users.
