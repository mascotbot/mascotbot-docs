### Module Resolution Issues in Next.js Pages Router

If you encounter errors like:

```bash
SyntaxError: Named export 'X' not found. The requested module '@rive-app/react-canvas' is a CommonJS module...
```

This occurs because Next.js Pages Router has stricter module resolution rules compared to App Router. To fix this:

1. Add `@mascotbot-sdk/react` to your `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import("next").NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  transpilePackages: ["@mascotbot-sdk/react"]
}
module.exports = nextConfig
```

2. If you're still seeing issues, try clearing your Next.js cache:

```bash
rm -rf .next
```

### `MascotCall` Common Issues

#### Transport State Stuck on "Connecting"

If the call state remains in "connecting":
- Check that your `apiUrl` is correct and accessible
- Ensure your browser has microphone permissions
- Check browser console for any WebRTC-related errors

#### Audio Issues

If you're experiencing audio problems:
1. Check microphone permissions in your browser
2. Verify that no other application is using the microphone
3. Try refreshing the page to reset WebRTC connections

#### Animation Not Playing

If the Rive animation isn't working:
1. Verify your Rive file URL is correct
2. Check that artboard and animation names match your Rive file
