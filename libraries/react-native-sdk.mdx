## Introduction

The MascotBOT SDK provides a set of tools and components to integrate interactive mascots into your React Native applications. This documentation will guide you through the installation process and explain the main mechanisms and hooks available in the SDK.

## Installation

To install the MascotBOT SDK, you need to add the package to your project. You can do this using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install ./mascotbot-react-native-0.1.3-preview.3.tgz
```

```bash yarn
yarn add ./mascotbot-react-native-0.1.3-preview.3.tgz
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add ./mascotbot-react-native-0.1.3-preview.3.tgz
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  You'll get the latest version of our SDK with integration examples once you
  subscribe to one of our plans
</Note>

Ensure that you have the required peer dependencies installed:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install expo expo-av expo-file-system rive-react-native
```

```bash yarn
yarn add expo expo-av expo-file-system rive-react-native
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add expo expo-av expo-file-system rive-react-native
```

</CodeGroup>

## Setup

### 1. Import and Wrap with `MascotProvider`

To use the SDK, wrap your application with the `MascotProvider` component.

```jsx
import { MascotProvider } from "@mascotbot/react-native";

function App() {
  return <MascotProvider>{/* Your application components */}</MascotProvider>;
}
```

### 2. Create a Rive Instance

To use animated mascots, you'll need to integrate with a Rive component:
For reference see the official Rive documentation to loading files [here](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/react-native/loading-rive-to-expo)

```jsx
import { MascotClient, MascotRive } from "@mascotbot/react-native";

function MyApp() {
  const RiveComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    return (
      <Rive
        ref={ref}
        style={{ width: "100%", height: 300 }}
        url="your_rive_file_url"
        autoplay={true}
      />
    );
  });
  return (
    <MascotClient RiveComponent={RiveComponent}>
      <MascotRive />
    </MascotClient>
  );
}
```

## Hooks

### `useMascot`

The `useMascot` hook provides access to the Rive instance and Rive component.

```jsx
import { useMascot } from "@mascotbot/react-native";

const { rive, RiveComponent } = useMascot();
```

### `useMascotPlayback`

The `useMascotPlayback` hook allows you to control the playback of animations and manage visemes.

```jsx
import { useMascotPlayback } from "@mascotbot/react-native";

const playback = useMascotPlayback();
playback.add();
playback.play();
playback.reset();
```

## Handling Visemes and Audio Playback

To create a synchronized animation and audio experience, you can use the `playback.add` method to add visemes. This can be done in various ways, such as fetching from a server, generating in real-time, or any other method suitable for your application.

### Adding Visemes

Visemes are visual representations of phonemes. You can add them to the playback to synchronize with the audio.

```jsx
const visemes = /* Obtain visemes from your source */;
playback.add(visemes);
```

### Controlling Speaking State

By default, the mascot's `is_speaking` state is automatically set to `true` while it's speaking and set to `false` when it stops. You can control this behavior by passing options to the `useMascotPlayback` hook:

```jsx
import { useMascotPlayback } from "@mascotbot/react-native";

// Default behavior - automatically set is_speaking state to true when speaking
const playback = useMascotPlayback();

// Disable automatic is_speaking state changes
const playback = useMascotPlayback({ setSpeakingState: false });
```

The `setSpeakingState` option allows you to disable the automatic management of the `is_speaking` state, giving you manual control over when and how the speaking state is set.
